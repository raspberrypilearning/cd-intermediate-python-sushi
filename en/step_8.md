## Wrapping up

Phew! It's done, you completed it, well done!

+ Try it out now. Create some quizzes with the creator program and then play them. Maybe get together with some friends and do a quiz together. You could see who can get the highest scores!

With all the new things you have learned now, you can do so much! Here are a couple of ideas, but I’m sure you could you think of better ones.

It would be cool, if you could edit quizzes with the quiz creator programme. Then you could come back and add more questions. If you load the data with the json library into python, then you could add more questions. You’d just have to replace everything in the file when you save it again.

How about you try setting up a scoreboard. It would be pretty cool, if you could keep a record of the highest scorer for a quiz. Then you could do competitions!

With all your new skills though you could do something completely different. You could build a game with guizero, or maybe use JSON data to show the weather!
